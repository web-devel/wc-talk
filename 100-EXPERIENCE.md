# Experience

## Technical issues

- Old browsers
  - polyfill is slow
  - polyfill has some limitations
- Custom elements
  - v0 â†’ v1 transition (`custom-elements-es5-adapter.js`)
  - inheritance
- No bundling - is a miracle (`polymer-cli`)
- Shadow DOM is pretty complicated and overhead for apllication-vise components
  - prevents global styling
  - nested slots are mindblowing
- `customElements.define` (bower)
  - far to ecosystem
- HTML Imports are dead
- still need some library in global scope

## Non-technical issues

- Being the first is not always good
- `Stick to platform` - sometimes hurts developer ergonomics
- Poor community
