# Why

### Landscape has changed
  - All modern browsers are evergreen
  - IE 11 is passing away

### Platform
  - In fact [more powerful](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) than your favorite transpiler

### Frameworks come and go. Platform remains.
  - Great interoperability
  - No bundling (at least in dev mode)
